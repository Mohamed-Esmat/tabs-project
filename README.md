## Introduction

This repository contains a Tabs project that showcases job information fetched from an external API. Users can navigate through the list of jobs and view details such as company, dates, job title, and duties. The application is built using React and utilizes various hooks and components to display job information dynamically.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project and fetch job information from the external API.

### Fetch Data

In the `App.jsx` file, utilize the fetch API to retrieve job information from the external API. Use the `useEffect` hook to make the API call when the component mounts. While the data is being fetched, set up a loading state to display a message to the user.

### State Value

Once the data has been fetched, store it in a state variable using the `useState` hook. This will allow you to modify the data and have those changes automatically reflected in the rendered output.

### JobInfo

Create a `JobInfo` component to display the details of the first job in the list. Use object destructuring to extract the relevant data from the job object. Display the company, dates, title, and duties, utilizing the `Duties` component to render the list of duties.

### JobDuties

In the `Duties` component, iterate over the array of duties and render each item. If you want to use icons, you will need to install the `react-icons` library.

### UUID Library

To generate unique ids for each job (as the job data does not have an id), install the `uuid` library:

```sh
npm install uuid
```

Then, import the library in your code:

```js
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
```

Use the generated ids instead of the index to set the `key` prop for the `JobInfo` and `Duties` components.

### BtnContainer

Set up a `BtnContainer` component and pass the jobs array, `currentItem` state variable, and `setCurrentItem` function down as props. In the `BtnContainer` component, create a button for each job in the jobs array.

### CurrentItem

Create a `currentItem` state variable in `App.jsx` and set it to 0 initially. Pass this state variable down to the `JobInfo` component as a prop, and use it to display the current job.

### SetCurrentItem

Attach the `setCurrentItem` function to each button. When the user clicks a button, the `setCurrentItem` function should be called with the index of the selected job. This function should update the `currentItem` state variable, causing the `JobInfo` component to render the selected job.
